# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2024-08-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to set up the features for the project into the [MOSCOW Method planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method).

## Decision

See README.md for full details, but we based all this off getting out a based MVP for our users.

## Consequences

If we did not define these guardrails, we could have spent months on V2, V3 or even unneeded features before we even had a product.
